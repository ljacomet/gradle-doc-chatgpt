Playground to have natural language questions with the specific context of recent Gradle documentation.

This is inspired by the work from @stephanj and his https://github.com/stephanj/llm-talk#4b-llm--groovy--qna[Groovy example].
I am not an experienced Python developer and so some of the instructions below might be redundant or un-necessary.
The same goes for the Jupyter notebook itself.

If you know better, PRs welcome.

## Install

Installations instructions provided for MacOS Apple Silicon based machines.

### Setup conda env and use Python 3.9

Install miniconda from Homebrew:
----
> brew install miniconda
> conda init "$(basename "${SHELL}")"
----

Setup our dedicated Python environment and some libraries:
----
> conda create --name jupyter python=3.9
> conda activate jupyter
> conda config --add channels conda-forge
> conda config --set channel_priority strict
> conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets
> ARCHFLAGS="-arch arm64" pip install hnswlib --compile --no-cache-dir
----

## Usage

Follow instructions in the Jupyter notebook.
Opening it in VSCode works just fine - once you install the suggested extensions.
